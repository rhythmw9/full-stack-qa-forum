- View questions in a selected category (newest → oldest)  
- Post new questions within a category (authenticated users)  
- Post answers to questions (authenticated users)  
- See inline error messages for invalid inputs and auth failures  
- Persist all data in MySQL for future sessions

## User Stories

- As a community member, I want to post questions and answers so I can learn from others and share what’s worked for me.  
- As a returning user, I want to log in and see recent posts in my category of interest so I can keep up with new advice.

## Technologies Used

- CSS  
- JavaScript
